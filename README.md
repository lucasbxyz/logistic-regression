This project uses logistic regression to predict whether a user will click on a website advertisement based on user characteristics. The dataset includes various features such as time spent on the website, age, regional income, and more. The goal is to create a reliable model that predicts whether a click on the ad occurs (Clicked on Ad: 1) or not (Clicked on Ad: 0). This project is an assignment from the Udemy course: [Python f√ºr Data Science, Machine Learning & Visualization](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-data-science-machine-learning).
